# Love Jam 2025
You can control the world, but not the consequences.

Made for the Love2d Game Jam (2025), all the graphics, audio and gameplay was made in 9 days over the course of around 80 Hours! This year I struggled to find a starting idea to expand on, I made several prototypes for other games which I might show off in a video like I did last year.

# Controls

- Q to clear save (hold for 3 seconds)
- Space to play (or click the on screen button)
